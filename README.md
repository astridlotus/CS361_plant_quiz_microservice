# CS361_microservice_A

This microservice is a plant light requirement quiz! It provides a GET request path, which gives the client a JSON object of questions and answer choices that the client is to pose to its user. These questions inquire about the type of plant and the light that it currently receives. This microservice also provides a POST route where the client can send the quiz results back to the microservice. The microservice analyzes the results and crafts a light recommendation message that it sends back in the response.

This microservice uses Node and Express to run locally on your device. Please read the following instructions for setup.
